![Project Overview](/node-app/screenshot/node-app.png)

Easily keep an eye on your Docker app with our simple monitoring tool. It's perfect for local checks and getting alerts set up right before you go live.

This framework is adaptable for further customization to meet your specific monitoring needs.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the Monitoring Stack installed, including Prometheus, AlertManager, Grafana, Node Exporter, MailHog, and NGINX on your local system.

Refer to our [comprehensive guide](https://github.com/thiagousa/youtube/tree/main/monitoring/docker) for detailed installation instructions, enabling you to set up your monitoring stack effortlessly.

## Installation Guide

### Step 1: Create Docker Image
Generate your application's Docker image, incorporating the exporter for metrics.

```bash
docker build -t node-app:1.0 .
```

### Step 2: Verify Image Creation
Confirm the Docker image has been successfully created.

```bash
docker images
```

### Step 3: Launch Docker Image
Deploy your Docker image, making sure to expose the necessary port.

```bash
docker run -itd -p 3333:3000 --name=node node-app:1.0
```

### Step 4: Validate Application and Metrics
Use a web browser to check if the application is active and metrics are accessible.

```bash
localhost:3333
localhost:3333/metrics
```

### Step 5: Configure Prometheus Scrape Target
Integrate your application into Prometheus by editing the `prometheus.yaml` file.

```bash
- job_name: "node-app"
  static_configs:
    - targets: ["node-app:3000"]
```

### Step 6: Set Up Alert Rules
Define your alert conditions within the `alert_rules.yaml` file in Prometheus.

```bash
- alert: Increase more than 10
  expr: increase(fake_metrics_counter[1m]) > 10
  for: 15s
  labels:
    severity: warning
  annotations:
    summary: Increase more than 10
    description: Increase more than 10
```

### Step 7: Set Service on Docker Compose file
Define your app service in the `docker-compose.yaml` . 

```bash
  node-app:
    image: node-app:1.0
    container_name: node-app
    ports:
      - 3000
    restart: unless-stopped
```


### Step 8: Configure Domain in Hosts File

#### For Linux or MacOS 🏠
Edit your `/etc/hosts` file to include:

```plaintext
127.0.0.1 node-app.acme.net
```

#### For Windows 🏠
- **Launch Notepad as Administrator**: 😎 Right-click Notepad in the Start menu and select "Run as administrator."
- **Open the Hosts File**: 📂 In Notepad, navigate to `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc`, change the file type to "All Files (*.*)," and open the `hosts` file.
- **Edit and Save**: 🖋️ Add the required entries and save your changes.

### Step 9: 🐳 Deploy Using Docker Compose

In the project directory, initiate the services with:

```bash

cd '/youtube/monitoring'   
docker compose down
docker compose up -d
```

### Step 10: 🔗 Access the Monitoring Services

Navigate to [All Services](http://services.acme.net) for full access to the monitoring components.

### Step 11: Configure NGINX Proxy

#### Nginx-Proxy-Manager 🌐

Utilize [Nginx-Proxy-Manager](http://nginx.acme.net/) for easy web proxying and SSL configuration, bypassing the complexities of manual Nginx or Letsencrypt setup.
