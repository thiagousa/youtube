   ```
   kubectl get pod 
   kubectl describe pod-wrong-way
   
3. **Expose the Pod:**
   ```
   kubectl expose pod pod-wrong-way --port 80
   ```
4. **Port-forwarding pod:**
   ```
   kubectl port-forward svc/pod-wrong-way 8888:80
   ```
6. **Access & Validate:** Visit http://localhost:8888/ to see your deployment in action.

7. **Delete pod:**
   ```
   kubectl delete pod pod-wrong-way
   ```
8. **Access & Validate:** Visit http://localhost:9999/ to see your deployment in action.

## The Correct Deployment Strategy

2. **Verify pod:**
   ```
   kubectl get pod 
   kubectl describe pod pod-right-way-{}
   ```
3. **Expose the deployment:**
   ```
   kubectl expose deployment pod-right-way --port 80
   ```
4. ** Port Forward the Service**
   ```
   kubectl port-forward svc/pod-right-way 9999:80
   ```
5. **Access & Validate:** Visit http://localhost:9999/ to see your deployment in action.
6. **Delete pod:**
   ```
   kubectl delete deployment pod-right-way
   ```
7. **Access & Validate:** Visit http://localhost:9999/ to see your deployment in action.
