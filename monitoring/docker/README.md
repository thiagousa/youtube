## Requirements

To set up your environment for using Docker, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

Docker Desktop: This is a necessary tool for running containerized applications. Make sure Docker Desktop is installed and operational on your system. You can download and install Docker Desktop from the official website at Docker Desktop.

Git: Git is a version control system often used for code management. It is essential for cloning repositories, managing source code versions, and collaborating with other developers. You can download Git from Git's official website.

Once you have these tools installed, you can proceed with setting up your Docker environment.

### Linux or MacOS üè† Edit Your Hosts File

Add the following entries to your `/etc/hosts` file:

```plaintext
127.0.0.1 nginx.acme.net
127.0.0.1 grafana.acme.net
127.0.0.1 prometheus.acme.net
127.0.0.1 alertmanager.acme.net
127.0.0.1 nodeexport.acme.net
127.0.0.1 mailhog.acme.net
127.0.0.1 services.acme.net
```

### Windows üè† Edit Your Hosts File

1. **Open Notepad as an Administrator**: üòé To wield your power and edit the Windows host file, let's start by right-clicking on the Notepad application in the Start menu. Choose "Run as administrator" because you're in control!

2. **Open the Hosts File**: üìÇ In Notepad, navigate to the sacred `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc` folder. You won't find the host file immediately because it's a bit of a ninja. To unmask it, change the file type to "All Files (*.*)."

3. **Edit the Hosts File**: üñãÔ∏è Select the `hosts` file and click "Open." This is your canvas!

4. **Add Host Entries**: ‚úçÔ∏è Now, let's sprinkle some magic. Add the host entries with the finesse of a maestro. For instance:

   ```
   127.0.0.1 nginx.acme.net
   127.0.0.1 grafana.acme.net
   127.0.0.1 prometheus.acme.net
   127.0.0.1 alertmanager.acme.net
   127.0.0.1 nodeexport.acme.net
   127.0.0.1 mailhog.acme.net
   127.0.0.1 services.acme.net
   ```

   Place these lines at the end of the hosts file, like icing on a cake!

5. **Save the Changes**: üìÅ After adding the enchanting host entries, let's seal the spell with a click. Choose "File" and then "Save" in Notepad.

6. **Close Notepad**: üö™ You've worked your magic! You can now elegantly close Notepad.

Certainly! Here's an updated `readme.md` section that explains how to clone the Git project:

## Requirements

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- **Docker Desktop**: You must have Docker Desktop installed and running on your system. You can download and install Docker Desktop from [https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

- **Operating System**: This project is designed to run on Linux-based systems. Ensure that you are using a compatible operating system.

## Cloning the Project

To get started with the Monitoring Stack project, follow these steps to clone the Git repository to your local machine:

1. **Open a Terminal or Command Prompt**: Launch your terminal application on your computer.

2. **Clone the Repository**: Run the following command to clone the Git repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/thiagousa/youtube.git
